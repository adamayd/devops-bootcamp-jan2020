Do your best to extend our script to add the following functionality

1. Allow user to pass in a list of usernames from a seperate text file. The script should read the list of names and perform the action that is specified(add or delete) on each name in the list.

2. Currently our script does not exit with proper exit codes on failures. Try to extend the script to exit with proper exit codes when failures happen
